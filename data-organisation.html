## What is reproducibility?

---

## Why is reproducibility important?

From an altruistic point of view, reproducibility is beneficial for the research community, and arguably society. 
--
In many cases, it is a minimum requirement for **verifying research**; when research can be verified, and by extension corrected, science is built on solid ground. 
--
Being able to reuse and build on available data and code saves time and resources, with the potential to speed up **innovation**. 

--

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

But reproducibility can also be beneficial for individual researchers!

## Reproducibility: benefits for individual researchers

&lt;!-- TODO: figure out how to get the parenthetical citation working--&gt;

There aren't only altruistic reasons to work reproducibly; it can be good for your career too!

Markowetz (2015)  notes **five selfish** reasons to work reproducibly.



---

## Reason 1: reproducibility helps to avoid disaster

--



![](images/nuijten-2016.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

--

- **1 in 2** examined papers had inconsistencies in the reported *p*-values
- **1 in 8** examined papers had inconsistencies large enough that they would affect the conclusions

---

## Reason 1: reproducibility helps to avoid disaster (cont'd)

--



![](images/ziemann-2016.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

--

- **1 in 5** papers in genetics is thought to have an error because of the default settings in Microsoft Excel reading in gene names as dates
- *To be continued...*

---

## Reason 2: reproducibility makes it easier to write papers

- with literate programming it's easy to combine text and code
  - meaning you can call your results into your document directly. No more copy-pasting = **no more-copy pasting errors** ‚ú®
  - if you collect more data or change your data cleaning, you just need to rerun the analyses and all results will update
- working reproducibly often involves automation and/or good documentation, making it more likely **you'll actually know what you did** when it's time to write up üíÉüèº

---

## Reason 3: reproducibility helps reviewers see it your way

Sharing the underlying code and data makes it possible for the reviewers to:
- understand exactly how you cleaned and analysed the data
- try out different analyses themselves
- spot mistakes in your codeüëÄ

---

## Reason 4: reproducibility enables continuity of your work

Good documentation of the data and code means:
- you'll be able to go to a project after a break (e.g., holidays, peer review)
- it's easier for others to pick up a project (important in long-term projects)

---

## Reason 5: reproducibility helps to build your reputation

Sharing and documenting your data and code well:
- helps you build a reputation as an honest and careful researcher
- if there is ever a problem with one of your papers you can show you did everything in good faith

---

## Conclusion

Working reproducibly doesn't mean that there will definitely not be any mistakes in your work.
But it does make it easier to figure out what went wrong and, by extension, to fix it.

--

Working reproducibly can also make the paper writing and reviewing process easier and more productive.

--

And it can help others build on your work and build your reputation.

## Data organisation in spreadsheets

## Software needed

.pull-left[
Microsoft Excel

&lt;img src="images/microsoft-excel.png" width="60%" height="60%" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[
Libre Office

![](images/libre-office.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

## Spreadsheets

.pull-left[

### Pros üëçüèº 

- Easy to use
- Good for data entry
- Can be handy for producing "quick and dirty" summary statistics and figures
]

.pull-right[
### Cons üëéüèº

- ‚ö†Ô∏è A lot of manual work
  - Easy to make mistakes (accidental deletions, formula misapplications, copy pasting errors)
  - Not reproducible (including errors)
- Non machine-readable formatting
- Data importing issues (dates, special characters)
]

---

## Manual work

---

## Non machine-readable formatting

Software can't process information that:
- relies on context
- notes in the margin
- spatial layout of data
- field formatting

to convey information

---

## Data importing issues

Scientists rename human genes to stop Microsoft Excel from misreading them as dates

---

## A better way is possible!

Data is stored in cells, coluumnsm and rows

- Each box is a cell
- Each column is a specific data feature
- Each row is an individual observation

---

## Create spreadsheets that are less error-prone, easier for computers to process, and easier to share

- Be consistent
- Write dates like YYYYMMDD (consider splitting into YYYY-MM-DD)
- Do not leave empty values (use code for missingness common in the programming language you will use; for Python: `None` or `NaN` - see [this chapter for more information on missingness in pandas](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.04-missing-values.html))
- Put as little information as possible in a single cell and one observation per row
- Create a data dictionary that describes the spreadsheet and any cleaning steps you took
- Leave the raw data alone!
- Do not use formatting (colours, font, bolding)
- Use data validation to avoid errors (Frictionless Data framework)

---

## Tidy data (R)

In tidy data:
- each variable forms a column
- each observation forms a row
- each cell is a single measurement

---

## Dataset for the workshop

The Portal Project Teaching Database

- Continuous data collection since 1977
- Site: part of the Chihuahuan Desert in the USA. 20 hectares split in 24 experimental plots
- Species: rodents
- a simplified version of the Portal Project Data (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6374066)
- variables:

---

## Exercise

üï¢ **10 mins**

- Download the messy data
- Open up the data in a spreadsheet programme
- Notice that there are two tabs. Two field assistants coducted the surveys, one in 2013 and one in 2014, and they both kept track of the data in their own ways in the tabs 2013 and 2014 of the dataset, respectively. Now you're the person in charge of this project and you want to be able to start analysing the data.
- You have 7 minutes to clean up as much of the dataset as you can.
- Once the 7 minutes are up:
  - take a screenshot of your cleaned dataset
  - add a comment describing what confused or annoyed you the most
- Check the screenshots and comments of the other participants and give them a +1 if you like their solution/comment

<div class="countdown" id="timer_62458232" style="right:0;bottom:0;" data-warnwhen="0">
<code class="countdown-time"><span class="countdown-digits minutes">07</span><span class="countdown-digits colon">:</span><span class="countdown-digits seconds">00</span></code>
</div>

---

## Exporting data in an open file format

- Accessible: usable by multiple types of software that are freely available (e.g. note that Microsoft requires a paid licence)
- Life expectancy: open file formats are more suitable for long-terms preservation because they don't rely ona single software programme
- Publishing: data repositories, journals and funding agencies may have requirements for open file formats
- Universal format: interoperable format that produces the same results when it is imported by various software programmes, including plain text editors
- Tab/comma delimited: comma-separated value files (.csv) are plain text files where the columns are separated by commas

---

## Exporting from Excel to .csv

1. From the top menu, select `File` and `Save as`
2. In the `Format` field select `Comma separated values (.csv)` from the list
3. Double check the file name and the location where you want to save the data and hit `Save`

---

## My data contains commas!

Enclose the data fields with double quotes and double check that the file you are exporting can be read in correctly.
