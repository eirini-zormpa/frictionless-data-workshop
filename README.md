# About
This repository contains the slides for the first part of the [FAIR and Frictionless workflows for tabular data workshop](https://community.data.4tu.nl/2022/03/22/workshop-fair-and-frictionless-workflows-for-tabular-data-online/) organised by 4TU.ResearchData and the [Frictionless Data initiative](https://frictionlessdata.io/) on 28 and 29 April 2022.

These slides cover the first part only, which provides an introduction to reproducibility and FAIR data, before delving into how to organise tabular data.
The latter part is based on the [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) lesson [Data Organization in Spreadsheets for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/).
These slides are an adaptation of Esther Plomp's slides (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5593434) and use [code written by Emily Riederer to create columns in a xaringan presentation](https://github.com/emilyriederer/xaringan_columns).
